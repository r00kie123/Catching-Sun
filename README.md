Catching Sun

Description
"Catching sun" is a game where the player can have fun and catch some positive vibes. The avatar is on her way through space and has to avoid collision with certain objects while colliding with and thereby catching other ones. The aim is to catch positive objects and avoid negative ones. Once the score reaches 0, the game ends. Also: Be careful with the gravity- don't let it get to strong or weak.
