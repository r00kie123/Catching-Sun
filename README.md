Trust The Process

Link Deploy

Description
"Trust The Process" is a game where the player can have fun and improve positive thinking at the same time. The avatar is on her way through space and has to avoid collision with certain obstacles while colliding with and thereby catching other ones. The aim is to catch positive objects and avoid negative ones. Once the score reaches 0, the game ends. Also: Be careful with the gravity- don't let it get to strong or weak. 

MVP

make sound for every collision
add inscructions on start page
add prettier startscreen/gameover screen with image
